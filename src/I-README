=== Angband 2.7.4 ===

There really isn't a proper README file for Angband 2.7.4 yet.

Angband is a "graphical" dungeon adventure game using textual characters
to represent the walls of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, in the
vein of "rogue", "hack", "nethack", and "moria".

This version of Angband will run on Unix/X11, Unix/Curses, Macintosh,
Linux/X11, Linux/Ncurses, and various forms of IBM compatibles...
See "Makefile.xxx" and "main-xxx.c" for more details...

Look at the files in ../lib/info for more information.
Look at Makefile, h-config.h, and config.h for details on compiling.

Send bug reports, suggestions, etc, to "benh@linc.cis.upenn.edu".
There is an Angband newsgroup: "rec.games.roguelike.angband".

Note that 2.7.4 is slightly advanced over 2.7.4-Beta from a week ago.
I recommend throwing out any versions of 2.7.4 that pre-date this one.
