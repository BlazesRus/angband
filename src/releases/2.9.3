Background
==========
Version 2.9.3 was released on 7th August 2001 by Robert R&uuml;hlmann, and was primarily a bugfixing and code-cleanup release.

Changelist
==========
 - Rogrog the Black Troll resists acid instead of cold.
 - Algroths resist poison.
 - Moved the player-class info to an external lib/edit/p_class.txt file.
 - Unified parts of the *_info.txt parsers.
  - Improved the error-messages when parsing *_info.txt files.
 - Examining an item that ignores all elements now shows "It cannot be
   harmed by the elements." instead of one line for each element.
 - Updated the documentation for the lib/edit/*.txt file formats.
 - The randart info is now stored in the savefile.
 - Various command-line options like wizard- and fiddle-mode are now
   available from the *.ini file of the Windows version.
 - Improved the GTK, X11, and XAW ports.
 - The cursor in the X11 and XAW modules is a rectangle, instead of a
   filled box.
 - Made the windows of the XAW module resizable.

   available).
 - Potions of life will now restore stats before healing to provide full
   health even if CON was drained.
 - Added the Linux vcsa display driver written by Alexander Malmberg.
 - Gave the *_info.txt files more meaningful names.
 - The EASY_KNOW flag is no longer hardcoded for various item types.
 - Added a workaround for a bug in the Borland compiler for Windows.  The
   game crashed when parsing an lib/edit/*.txt file containing 11 player
   races.
 - Fixed a bug that could cause the random artifacts to be different
   depending on the used compiler and optimizations.
 - Replaced several magic numbers with the proper constants.
 - The lesser vault "Planet X" was labeled as greater vault.
 - If a custom player race has both an elemental immunity and resistance
   then only the resistance was shown in the character display grid.
 - Fixed a typo in the "bless" spell.
 - Ego-items generated in vaults should now be of the proper level.
 - Used staircases are now always marked as known when the connected_stairs
   option is turned on.
 - Added a new macro action that stops macro execution when the game is at
   a prompt, and is ignored otherwise.
 - One type of cross shaped rooms was never been generated.
 - The error checking when parsing artifact.txt, ego_item.txt, monster.txt,
   and p_race.txt didn't warn about duplicated entries.
 - It's now possible to create junk items in wizard mode.
 - The easy_open option no longer counts doors under the player when
    determining which door to close.
 - The cheat_know option marked monsters as known even after it was turned
   off.
 - The experience gained from killing monsters was sometimes incorrect
   after tweaking the maximum experience in wizard mode.
 - The spell-info for the mage's fire-bolt spell was used for the stone to
   mud spell.
 - Examining an item in the home displayed the item as if it was
   identified, even if it wasn't.
 - The Windows version didn't exit correctly when starting with a savefile
   from the command-line.
 - Pref files for player races were not loaded automatically.
 - Fixed a compile problem in the Windows version when USE_GRAPHICS is
   turned off.
 - The random selection of sound samples in the Windows and DOS version got
   non-random after a while.
 - The message when dropping a known artifact is now something like "You no
   longer have the Golden Crown of Gondor" instead of "You have no more
   Golden Crowns of Gondor".
 - Finding out that a wand or staff has no charges left didn't update the
   inventory window.
 - Attacks that didn't do any damage could sometimes scare wounded monsters.
 - Monsters at 1% of max hps got frightened less often than monsters with
   10% hps left.
 - The item flag descriptions when tweaking items in wizard mode are now
   correct.
  - Removed the special handling for weapons of Morgul and ammo of backbiting.
 - Moved the "Lesser vault" and "Greater vault" strings into the source.
 - The get_string() and askfor_aux() functions now use the 'len' argument
   as the buffer size instead of the maximum length of the input string.
 - Corrected the message when encountering an error while parsing a
   lib/edit/*.txt file.
 - The path_temp() function is no longer compiled if mkstemp() is
   available.
 - Removed a hack for the curses module of some BSD versions.
 - Fixed some problems on BSD machines with the ACS macros for the special
   curses font symbols.
 - The *_info.txt parsing routines can now be turned off with the
   ALLOW_TEMPLATES #define.
 - The *.prf file loading code checks for invalid message colors.
 - Fixed the inversed logic for handling tabs in files.
 - Changed the title of the 'Known artifacts' list to the more truthful
   'Known (or lost) artifacts'.
 - Changed the message when looking at un-\*id*'ed artifacts/ego-items to
   "It might have hidden powers.".
 - Changed the monster memory info when you have avenged your ancestor to a
   gender-neutral form.
 - The error message "Couldn't allocate bitmap color" in the X11 version
   displayed an uninitialized colour name.
 - Corrected the names of some options in the documentation.
 - Fixed some errors in the lsl module, but it's still buggy.
 - Improved the autoconf support. The Cygwin compiler is now supported,
   detection routines for the X11, XAW, and GCU modules have been improved,
   DESTDIR is now supported, and a workaround for a bug in some versions of
   the GCC compiler is turned on.
