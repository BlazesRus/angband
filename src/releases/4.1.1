One of the defining features of Angband has always been the fact that new levels (aside from the town) are always freshly generated.  In 4.1.1, an experimental birth option was introduced in levels persist, so each level is only generated once and the player can return to previously visited levels.

Version 4.1.1 also fixed bugs in 4.1.0, and was released on Thursday the 16th of November 2017.
