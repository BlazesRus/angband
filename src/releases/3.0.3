Background
==========
Version 3.0.3 was released on 26th January 2003 by Robert R&uuml;hlmann, and fixed a few niggly bugs.

Changelist
==========
 - Reduced the size of the 32x32 tiles bitmap.  The smaller bitmap should
   fix the problem on older Windows versions (Windows 95 and 98) with
   restrictions of the maximal bitmap size .
   The tiles are available as a separate download from:
   ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-302.zip
 - Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for character dumps that
   sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported by Pasi Vartiainen)
 - Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11 startup shell script.
   ("Mynstral")
 - Fixed the display of \*slays* in character dumps. (Matthias Kurzke)
 - The "It might have hidden powers." message will now displayed in the
   character dumps.  This makes it easier to see if an artifact or ego-item
   with random abilities has already been \*identified*.
 - Curses on unidentified items are no longer revealed in character dumps or
   in the output of the 'Inspect' command.
 - Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)
 - Updated the DOS version to compile with the latest version of the Allegro
   library.
