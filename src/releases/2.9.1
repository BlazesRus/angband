Background
==========
Version 2.9.1 was released on 25th July 2000 by Robert R&uuml;hlmann.  It followed a familiar pattern of fixing hosts of bugs and making internal cleanups, such as allowing the limits on numbers of items and monsters to be set in the edit files, making them substantially more useful as a way of altering the game.  It also featured UI and platform-specific improvements, and several new vaults.
