Background
==========
Version 2.7.8 was released to the world on 4th September 1995, and was Ben Harrison's second stable release of the game - one he said should be recommended to "your friends without net access".  As such, it underwent a longer-than-normal period of testing before release, though it still contained any number of fairly major code-level and gameplay changes.

One such change was the addition of a "destroy" command, something that later players would find it hard to live without.  Before this version, the only way to destroy an item was to throw it so that it would break, traditionally at a wall or at oneself.  This could be considered the start of the slippery slope towards a tidy dungeon and the introduction of "squelching" - the automated destruction of items that the player is not interested in - which made it to the game in [version 3.0.7](http://rephial.org/release/3.0.7) a mere twelve years later.  In fact, squelching had [been proposed][squelch] as an addition to the game in r.g.r.a a mere two posts after Ben announced the "destroy" command was being /considered/ for inclusion.

There was another long-term, perhaps unexpected, effect of this release as player ghosts were "temporarily" removed from the game.  These had been one of the staple features of previous versions and a good way for players to find a great reward or an early death for their characters.  Their removal was because of the various hacks that were used in the code to allow the ghosts to exist, and they were promised to return when a new way to implement them was found.  As of the latest release at the time of writing, they are yet to reappear.[*2]

As this was intended as a super-stable version, Ben also went to special effort to ensure that savefiles from earlier versions of the game, as far back as [2.5.1](http://rephial.org/release/2.5.1) and [frog-knows](http://rephial.org/release/2.4.fk), would be safely loaded by the game.  Though not without modifications, such as any player ghosts being killed, or other things that could not be supported by the new version.
