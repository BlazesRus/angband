Background
==========
Version 2.7.1 was released on 17th January 1997, and is a fair illustration of the development process used by Ben Harrison - release early, release often - with this release coming just a week after 2.7.0.  It incorporated more internal code cleanup, bugfixes from the first release, and (obviously) more bugs caused by the rewriting work.  [2.7.4](http://rephial.org/release/2.7.4) was the first version Ben considered a "stable beta" rather than just beta.
