Background
==========
Version 2.7.3 was released on 24th February 1995, and made relatively few changes in an attempt to get closer to a stable, bug-free changes.  Despite this aim, there /were/ more behind-the-scenes cleanups and changes, such as the introduction of a fractional speed system whereby actions can take less than a turn. 

As such, the intended "stable beta" release was pushed back to [2.7.4](http://rephial.org/release/2.7.4).
