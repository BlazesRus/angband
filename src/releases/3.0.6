Background
==========
Version 3.0.6 was released on 18th June 2005 by Robert R&uuml;hlmann, more than a year after the previous release, and Robert's last as Angband maintainer.  Shortly after this, in October 2005, he announced that he no longer wished to be Angband maintainer, as he was no longer enjoying the job, and feeling "burnt out".  While he was willing to continue packaging up other people's bugfixes and patches, if anyone wanted to step forward with the support of the community he was more than happy to step down.

Still, this release didn't keep the game standing still, with a large collection of bugfixes, platform-specific improvements and gameplay tweaks.

Changelist
==========
 - Wands and staves are no longer destroyed when a recharge attempt
   backfires.  Instead all the charges are drained.
 - Renamed the artifact short sword 'Gilettar' to 'Dagmor' since that
   name is mentioned for the sword of Beren in Tolkien's notes.
   (suggested by Tyler Witter)
 - Added a new type of subwindow for displaying the dungeon area around
   the player.
 - Added a new subwindow type "Display player (compact)" that displays
   the left-hand-side of the main term (player stats, hitpoints, gold,
   ...) in a separate window.
 - Added a new window type that displays the info from the status line.
 - Turned the "scroll map while targeting" option permanently on.
 - Added a display of the temporary resists to the status line.  The
   resists are only displayed if there is enough room after the dungeon
   level (when using a main or status term with at least 85 cols).
   The verbosity of the output (between "Acid Elec Fire Cold Pois" and
   "AEFCP") depends on the term width.
 - Display the player's speed in the character dump and on the info page.
 - Identified scrolls can now look different from unidentified ones.
   This allows the use of the individual scroll tiles created by David
   Gervais.
 - Allow the ammo-branding activation of 'Cubragol' to be aborted without
   using up the charge. (Diego Gonzalez and Jeff Greene)
 - Use actual monster and object symbols instead of a list of hardcoded
   symbols when hallucinating.
 - Added Craig Oliver's Sound FX Patch version 1.1 that adds about 120
   new sound events to the game.
   (see also http://www.chambrook.org/angband/soundfx.php)
 - Scroll the map when the player is 1/4th of the visible grids away from
    the edge of the map display.
 - Allow the OS X version to be started from a read-only medium, for
   example from a disk image or a central installation under
   'Applications'.  All user-specific files like savefiles, scores,
   char-dumps, and saved preferences are stored in
   Library\/Preferences\/Angband\/' and its subfolders inside the user's
   home directory.
 - The Mac OS X application bundle now includes all the necessary files
    from the lib folder.  The separate lib folder in the distribution is
   no longer necessary.  This means that the OS X version can now be
   installed by simply dragging the application icon to the target
   directory.
 - The OS X version would crash when changing the sound or graphics
   options before a character was created or loaded. (reported by Patrick
    Hughes)
 - Don't save the Mac OS X preferences on exit if the game hasn't been
   initialized properly to prevent corruption of the preference file in
   case of an error at startup.  Skip loading the preference file if it
   is broken. (problem reported by Matt Stone)
 - Include the basic Angband sound files per default in the OS X version.
 - Made the tile size independent of the font size in the X11 version.
   Store various window settings like the window size between sessions.
 - Don't add a hardcoded 'games' subdirectory to the installation path on
   multi-user machines.
 - Allow all user created files to be saved in subdirectories under
   ~\/.angband/Angband/ when PRIVATE_USER_PATH is defined.
 - Allow the use of the 'vcs' display module on systems with devfs-style
   '\/dev/vc/*' terminals.
 - The virtual console (vcs) front-end does now implement cursor
   visibility and bigscreen support.  (Alexander Ulyanov)
 - Enable cursor visibility in the "gcu" front-end on Linux systems.
   (Alexander Ulyanov)
 - Fixed a bug in the Xaw frontend, which made Angband crash if the main
   window geometry was specified as an X resource. (Alexander Ulyanov)
 - Make X11 frontends show floors as centered dots, walls as blocks, and
   treasures as diamonds. (Alexander Ulyanov)
 - Removed the restriction of bigtile mode to the main window in the X11
   version.
 - Added Alexander Ulyanov's Linux framebuffer display module from:
   http://posband.earthsea.org/misc/angband-lfb-20050220.tar.gz
 - Added compile instructions for MinGW/MSYS on Windows. (Tuomas
   Härkönen)
 - Added compile instructions for gcc on Mac OS X.
 - Fixed a stupid bug that could cause the game to hang or crash when
   killing quest monsters near the edge of the dungeon. (Ivan Tuckwell
   and Dr. Andrew White)
 - Added missing tiles and tile assignments for the 32x32 tiles. (Ivan
   Jekic and David Gervais)
 - The charges of rods of perception weren't handled correctly when
   compiling with scripting turned off. (reported by "Twilight" and Jeff
   Greene)
 - Cursed speed rings should not increase the level feeling. (Anssi
   Ramela and Jeff Greene)
 - Refresh the list of visible monsters after (Mass) Banishment,
   Earthquake, and Destruction spells, when using the 'delete nearby
   monsters' function in debug mode, as well as when pressing Ctrl-R.
   ("Twilight")
 - Don't try to write zero-length blocks when saving the lib/data/*.raw
   files. (suggested by Juha Niemimaki)
 - Corrected the item description for scrolls of recharging. (reported by
   Hugo Kornelis)
 - The experience loss as a result of one of the One Ring's activations
   is now 1/4 of both max and current experience instead of the
   unintended reduction of max exp by 3/16 of the current experience.
   (Hugo Kornelis)
 - Cleaned up the handling of experience draining when the player has
   Hold Life. The fixed part of the exp drain by nether breaths is now
   also reduced by Hold Life. (Hugo Kornelis)
 - The 'star ball' activation fired one ball more when scripting was
   enabled.  (Hugo Kornelis)
 - The object description for the 'cure wounds' activation reads
   "activates for cure wounds (4d7)", but it actually cures 4d8 points of
   damage.  The description has been fixed. (Hugo Kornelis)
 - The "recharge item" artifact activation can now be canceled at the
   "Recharge which item" prompt without draining the artifact's charge.
   (Hugo Kornelis)
 - The symbol for the Shield of Deflection was a light blue [ instead of
   a ) like all other shields. (Hugo Kornelis)
 - Reduced the price for "Raal's Tome of Destruction". (Hugo Kornelis and
   Timo Pietila)
