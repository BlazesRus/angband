Background
==========
2.6.1 was a "stable" release made on 18th September 1994. The game was now playable on a huge range of UNIX platforms and was ported to others including the Mac, and it was from the Mac port of this version that Ben Harrison was to launch his assault on the game's internal structures when he took over as maintainer (and, indeed, before).
