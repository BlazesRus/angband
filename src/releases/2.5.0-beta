Background
==========
2.5.0-beta was released on 8th December 1993, and was the first release after the legendary Frog-knows release.  It marked the start of Charles Swiger's time as Angband maintainer, which lasted around a year and ended with the 2.6.2 release late in 1994.  

Charles took over almost by default a version for UNIX that had no ambitions to be a separate game (unlike FAngband, the first variant), at around the time the Angband FTP maintainer was giving up on being able to regain contact with Sean Marsh and so was looking for a new "official" maintainer.  This manner of accession to the maintainership was to become a regular feature of Angband's history over the next thirteen years.

His releases at first consisted of very many bugfixes and a gradual flow of new features.  Many of the bugfixes and features were taken from suggestions and patches made on the net, or drawn directly from UMoria 5.5, PCAngband 1.3 and FAngband.  As a result, many of these features and bugfixes are probably also found on the changelists for the PCAngband releases.
