<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>My real name is Chris. If you want more info, try <a href="http://www.terminalarrogance.com">http://www.terminalarrogance.com</a><p>I&#39;ve been playing roguelikes since a friend introduced me to Moria in 1989, but I left university at exactly the wrong time - just before Angband was unleashed on the world - so I didn&#39;t discover it until a lull in RL in 2000. Since then I&#39;ve played a lot of <a class="extlink" href="http://runegold.org/sangband">Sangband</a>, quite a bit of V and <a class="extlink" href="http://oangband.com">Oangband</a> and have tried a few other variants. I tend to play in bursts - I get hooked on a particular variant, play a lot, then lose a really enjoyable or promising character to a stupid death, and move on to do something else. Sometimes it is months before I get tempted to try a *band again, since they compete with tons of other games for my spare time.</div></div>
