<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>He wrote some code for making that Angband work on Mac OS X (Cocoa).<p>We know his email address was randerso@cais.com at some point because it was mentioned in <a href="http://www.zangband.org/dchanges.html">http://www.zangband.org/dchanges.html</a> -- but that email address doesn&#39;t work anymore.<p>AndrewSidwell (takkaria) wrote that based on <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/showitem.jhtml?docid=1702anderson">http://www.networkcomputing.com/showitem.jhtml?docid=1702anderson</a> and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2006/01/ron_in_india_da.html">http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2006/01/ron_in_india_da.html</a> his email address must have been randerson@nwc.com (Jan 2006), but that there was no reply as of 1 June 2007. AndrewSidwell, why do you think that is the same RonAnderson? I think it easily could be a different RonAnderson, a technology writer, not a developer. Nevertheless, in Nov 2008, JasonSpiro phoned up the publisher of the now-defunct networkcomputing.com. They spoke with someone who used to know him. They said Ron doesn&#39;t work there anymore, and they think he is at Syracuse University now. They also said that Lorna Garey (lgarey <u>at</u> techweb.com) might know how to contact him.<p>Based on web searches, it seems to JasonSpiro that the only RonAnderson Mac OS X software developer online is one who has worked at America Online -- see <a href="http://google.com/search?q=%22ron+anderson%22+%22aol+llc%22+apple">http://google.com/search?q=%22ron+anderson%22+%22aol+llc%22+apple</a> to read some of the posts he has written. But Jason could not find that Ron&#39;s email address online until he realized that some posts -- such as <a href="http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2003/5/1/89685">http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2003/5/1/89685</a> -- were From: AndersonJRon. A Google search for AndersonJRon shows that his AOL email address is andersonjron <u>at</u> aol.com.<p>Here is the email that JasonSpiro sent to Ron:<pre> From: Jason Spiro &lt;jasonspiro4 _at_ gmail.com&gt;

 I sent you a copy of this mail two months ago, in Dec. 2008, but you did
 not reply, so I am resending it.
