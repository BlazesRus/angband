<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>I&#39;m tired of seeing a question mark next to my name :)<p>I&#39;ve been playing Angband for 2 or 3 years, although I think I may have played Moria a long time back, as some of Angband seemed very familiar when I came across it.<p>I live in Worthing, West Sussex - married, with one son. Also a dog, a cat and 2 fish.<p>Very active in local politics, representing <a class="extlink" href="http://www.wor-ld.org.uk">Worthing Liberal Democrats</a>, and have been a councillor on and off since 1995. In 2003-4, I was the Mayor of Worthing<p>Passionate about theatre, particularly Shakespeare; I&#39;ve acted and directed in most of his plays, including playing Othello and Coriolanus, and in 2007 was nominated in the Portsmouth Evening Awards as Best Actor for playing John Proctor in The Crucible. In 2008 I will be playing the Inspector in An Inspector Calls.<p>Reading includes Tolkien (obviously), most mythology, some F&amp;SF but not as much as a while back, a lot of historical fact, and classical literature. Authors I&#39;d recommend to anyone: Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials trilogy), James Lee Burke, Ursula K. LeGuin<p>I can be contacted at actaeon at republicofheaven dot org dot uk</div></div>
