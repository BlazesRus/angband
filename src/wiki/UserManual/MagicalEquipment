<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">Enchanted Weapons and Armour</h3><p>All arms and armour can be enhanced through enchantment. Such magical equipment can be found in the dungeons; recovered from slain foes; bought (for exorbitant prices) in <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/TheTown">the Town</a>; or created by using certain spells or scrolls.<p>The enchantment is shown in the display of the item, for example:<pre> a Metal Cap [3, +2]
 a Dagger (1d4) (+1, +2)
</pre><p>Armour enchantments increase the total armour class of the item. Weapon enchantments increase either the bonus used to calculate the probability of a hit (the first number in the parentheses), or the bonus used when calculating damage dealt (the second number).<h4 id="s2_1">Enchanting Equipment Yourself</h4><p>When enchanting an item with a spell or scroll, the chances of success decrease as the current bonus rises. Getting to +3 is easy, +7 is certainly possible, but after +9 or +10 the chance of a successful enchantment drops sharply. A failure has no negative effect other than wasting a scroll or mana.<p>It is possible to enchant a group of identical objects held in a single inventory slot (e.g. 99 Arrows), but the greater the number in the group, the smaller the chance of success.<p>A cursed item (see below) can sometimes have the curse broken by enchanting the item.<h4 id="s2_2">Disenchantment</h4><p>Items can be disenchanted by some magical creatures, losing one or more bonus points when an attack by one of these monsters is successful. Bonuses can also be lost due to acid attacks. Losing points <i>can</i> result in items having negative bonuses, e.g. a Cloak [1, -1].<h4 id="s2_3">Cursed Items</h4><p>Some items when found will have been cursed with negative bonuses. Wearing or wielding such an item will make a character feel a deathly chill, and the item cannot them be put down or taken off until the curse is magically removed.</div><hr /><div class="page"><table border="1"><tr><th align="center" width="33%">Previous Page</th><th width="33%">Up</th><th align="center" width="33%">Next Page</th></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/Armour">Preventing Injuries</a></td><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual">Index</a></td><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/EgoItems">Ego-Items</a></td></tr></table></div></div>
