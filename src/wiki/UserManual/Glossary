<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h4 id="s2_1"><b>Activated Ability</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_2"><b>Character Dump</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_3"><b>Critical Hit</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_4"><b>Ego Item</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_5"><b>GP</b>: </h4><p>Gold pieces, the currency of Angband. The value of any money or gems you find will be expressed as a number of GP.<h4 id="s2_6"><b>Hit Points</b>:</h4><p>HP represent the damage your character can take in combat. If reduced to zero, your character dies. Hit Points increase with experience level, and are based on race, class and CONstitution.<h4 id="s2_7"><b>Ironman</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_8"><b>Mana</b>:</h4><p>Mana is the power used to cast spells. Each spell has a specific casting cost in mana points, which is deducted from the character&#39;s mana when the spell is cast. Your character&#39;s mana total is based on race, INTelligence, and experience level. When mana is reduced from its maximum level due to spells being cast, or mana being drained by magical creatures, it is regenerated over time - more quickly if your character&#39;s INTelligence is higher.<h4 id="s2_9"><b>Prayer</b>:</h4><p>An equivalent term for spell for certain classes (Priest, Paladin) whose magical abilities derive from the deity they worship rather than innate magical power.<h4 id="s2_10"><b>Pseudo-ID</b>:</h4><p>The ability to sense magical qualities of unknown weapons and armour when they pick them up in the dungeon. All characters have this, but not to the same extent - the speed with which a character senses magic, and the detail they sense, is modified by race, class and stats. It is called Pseudo-ID because it is related to the Identify ability available as a spell, on scrolls, and through Staves and Rods of Perception, but does not give the full detailed information, merely a descriptive flavour, such as {good}, {cursed}, etc..<h4 id="s2_11"><b>Scumming</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_12"><b>Squelching</b>: </h4><h4 id="s2_13"><b>Sustain</b>:</h4></div></div>
