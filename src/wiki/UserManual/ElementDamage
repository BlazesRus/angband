<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>Damage is more than just hit points... there are other effects as well. Some attacks will leave you stunned or paralyzed, others may damage objects in your pack.<h3 id="s1_1">First things First</h3><p>Most effects won&#39;t kill you immediately -- they might be rather painful, but you still have the chance to bug out and then wonder what happened. The one exception is paralysis: nothing can be done when paralysed. It&#39;s quite agonising to watch your character take blow after blow while being completely unable to do anything about it.<p>Usually, the game gives the danger first and the remedy later: you&#39;ll be blinded many times before you find something that protects you from blindness, for example. However, protection from paralysis is available some time before you first encounter a paralyzing monster &ndash; <b><i>if you see something that protects you from paralysis (aka &quot;free action&quot;), take it and wield it!</i></b> It will save your life.<p>That said, this page will now continue to give you a pretty good overview of all kinds of damage and effects you may encounter; and might well be considered a spoiler. If you just started with Angband, you don&#39;t need to know this, and besides: it&#39;s a lot of text. You might better consider this article as a resource you can refer to later.<ul><li><a href="#s1_1">First things First</a><li><a href="#s1_2">Temporary Effects</a><ul><li><a href="#s2_1">Fear</a><li><a href="#s2_2">Blindness</a><li><a href="#s2_3">Confusion</a><li><a href="#s2_4">Concussion</a><li><a href="#s2_5">Cuts</a><li><a href="#s2_6">Poison</a><li><a href="#s2_7">Paralysis</a></ul><li><a href="#s1_3">Elements</a><ul><li><a href="#s2_8">Overview</a><li><a href="#s2_9">Resistance to Damage</a></ul></ul><h3 id="s1_2">Temporary Effects</h3><p>All of these will wear off after some time -- possibly after a very long time, but eventually they will get better.<h4 id="s2_1">Fear</h4><p>You&#39;re afraid and cannot attack in melee.<h4 id="s2_2">Blindness</h4><p>You&#39;re blind. Should be rather obvious, really... you may still strike or shoot in the direction where you suspect an opponent, but the to-hit chance is much reduced. Spellcasting and praying is impossible, but using devices (wands, staves, rods) still works.<h4 id="s2_3">Confusion</h4><p>You&#39;re confused. Movement and melee has a high chance of being random, aiming is completely random (aiming means: throwing/shooting an object, using a wand or rod, etc). You cannot read spells or prayers from books and scrolls, but may be able to activate an device (though the failure rate is high)<h4 id="s2_4">Concussion</h4><p>You&#39;re stunned. Impairs your fighting and spellcasting abilities, but nowhere as much as confusion. &quot;Heavy stun&quot; is the same but worse, and if you&#39;re &quot;knocked out&quot; -- well, that&#39;s pretty much the same as paralysis. Don&#39;t let it happen to you.<h4 id="s2_5">Cuts</h4><p>Cuts prevent hit point regeneration, and also cause loss of hit points every turn from bleeding. Here is a table showing the various degrees of cut severity:<pre>                              Damage
 Cut counter   Description  per turn
 -----------------------------------
      1-10         Graze         1
     11-25     Light cut         1
     26-50       Bad cut         1
    51-100     Nasty cut         1
   101-200    Severe cut         2
  201-1000     Deep gash         3
     1000+  Mortal wound         3
</pre><p>Every turn the wound heals a bit, high Constitution helps. If you run out of hitpoints before the wound is full healed, you die.<h4 id="s2_6">Poison</h4><p>You&#39;re poisoned. This works pretty much like cuts, only that it&#39;s much more common and you have no means of telling how badly poisoned you are.<h4 id="s2_7">Paralysis</h4><p>You cannot do anything as long as the paralysis lasts, and are vulnerable to attacks and further paralysis. This can easily be lethal.<h3 id="s1_3">Elements</h3><p>The simplest elements in Angband are Fire, Frost, Acid and Electricity. These are called the &quot;Basic Four&quot;, either because they&#39;re so common or maybe because they were the first elements in the game. There&#39;s quite a few more, though, some have several names and not all work strictly in the same way. In short, the whole topic of &quot;elements&quot; is bound to be somewhat confusing.<h4 id="s2_8">Overview</h4><p>There&#39;s a few things they all have in common, though:<p>a. Elemental (or &quot;Branded&quot;) attacks tend to do much more damage than ordinary hits.<p>b. Technically speaking, elements do damage with a flavor: later in the game, many monsters (as well as your character) will be resistant to some, but not all elements. This occasionally creates sword/scissors/rock-like situations.<p>c. Elemental attacks have side effects: <i>acid</i> may damage your armor, <i>sound</i> may stun your character, and so on.<h4 id="s2_9">Resistance to Damage</h4><ol type="a"><li>&#39;&#39;Magic Resistance:&#39;&#39; The alchemist usually sells potions of Resist Heat and Resist Cold; there&#39;s also spells that provide resistance to some or all of the basic four elements. While the effect lasts, the damage you take from the respective element will be reduced to 1/3rd.<li>&#39;&#39;Resistance through Equipment:&#39;&#39; many items will make you resistant to some or several elements. Mostly armor, of course, but also branded weapons: for example, a <i>Rapier of Acid</i> will usually also provide resistance to acid, for example. While you wear or wield such a piece of equipment, you will likewise only take 1/3rd of the nominal damage. Having it once is enough, though: if your shield makes you resistant to a certain element, wearing a suit of armor that provides the same resistance won&#39;t improve the protection.<li>&#39;&#39;Double Resistance:&#39;&#39; if you&#39;re resistant due to equipment and also apply a spell or potion, these two reinfore each other. You&#39;ll take only 1/9th of the nominal damage.</ol></div></div>
