<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>Various concepts mentioned below:<ul><li>&quot;disturb&quot;: cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands<li>&quot;flush&quot;: forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any macros in progress</ul><p>Options you may want to change to your preferences include:<ul><li>Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other roguelike games, or have no number pad.<li>Checking that the hit point warning is non-zero can save your character&#39;s life.<li>Set the delay factor to two or more if you want to see pretty ball explosions and whatnot.<li>Playing around with the lighting options in the Display Options section can be a lot of fun.</ul><p>Contents:<ul><li><a href="#s1_1">Interface options</a><li><a href="#s1_2">Display options</a><li><a href="#s1_3">Warning options</a><li><a href="#s1_4">Birth (difficulty) options</a><ul><li><a href="#s2_1">Ironman Play</a><li><a href="#s2_2">Monster AI options</a></ul><li><a href="#s1_5">Cheat options</a><li><a href="#s1_6">Subwindow display settings</a><li><a href="#s1_7">Miscellaneous Options</a></ul></div><hr /><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">Interface options</h3><dl><dt>Use sound (use_sound)<dd><p>Turn on sound effects, if your system supports it.<dt>Rogue-like commands (rogue_like_commands)<dd><p>Selects the &quot;roguelike&quot; command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to move the character about. This command set can be really useful if you have no number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it. However, the original command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.<dt>Use old target by default (use_old_target)<dd><p>Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current target if there is one. Use of this option can be dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.<dt>Pick things up by default (always_pickup)<dt>Display things before picking them up (query_floor)<dd><p>When &quot;always_pickup&quot; is on, the game assumes you want to pick up any object you encounter. If &quot;query_floor&quot; is off, you pick up objects automatically. Otherwise, you are shown a list and prompted to pick up.<p>When &quot;always_pickup&quot; is off, the game assumes you want to pick things up selectively. If &quot;query_floor&quot; is off, you get a one-line description of the object or pile. If &quot;query_floor&quot; is on, you see a full list, including weights. In either case, you can start picking things up by typing &quot;g&quot;.<p>When standing still, you are never charged extra time for picking up objects. When walking, you always take a second partial turn to pick up objects; each object picked up takes 1/10th of a turn.</dl><dl><dt>Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement (easy_alter)<dd>When you move into a door, you attempt to open it. When you move into a trap, you attempt to disarm it.<dt>Open/Disarm/Close without direction (easy_open)<dd>When you issue the open, close, or disarm commands, and there is only one useable door or visible trap adjacent to you, it is selected automatically.<dt>Verify use of special commands (verify_special)<dd>Asks if you are certain before entering wizard, debug, or borg mode (if allowed).</dl><h3 id="s1_2">Display options</h3><dl><dt>Player color indicates low hit points (hp_changes_color)<dd>This option makes the player (&#39;@&#39;) turn various shades from white to red depending on % HP remaining.<dt>Show dungeon level in feet (depth_in_feet)<dd>Displays dungeon level in feet, as opposed to level.<dt>Hilite the player with the cursor (hilite_player)<dd>Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some UNIX terminals, but horrible on most graphics machines.<dt>Center map continuously (slow) (center_player)<dd>Center the map continuously. Advantages include removal of the need to adjust the map panel and less jerky character movement; disadvantages include not being able to control your field of view and constant map shifting. Substantially slows down the game.<dt>Show stacks using special attr/char (show_piles)<dd>Displays a stack of floor objects using a special character.<dt>Show flavors in object descriptions (show_flavors)<dd>Display &quot;flavors&quot; (color or variety) in object descriptions and information screens, even for objects whose type is known. This does not affect objects in stores.<dt>Show labels in equipment listings (show_labels)<dd>Display &quot;labels&quot; (what an object is being used for) for objects in all equipment listings.<dt>Use special colors for torch lite (view_yellow_lite)<dd>If the option &quot;view_special_light&quot; is also on, floor grids that are only lit by the player&#39;s own light source will appear yellow. If the option &quot;view_granite_light&quot; is on, walls will be colored in the same way. Turning this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.<dt>Use special colors for field of view (view_bright_lite)<dd>If the option &quot;view_special_light&quot; is also on, those floor grids that the player can see directly appear white, and all other known grids appear dark gray. If the option &quot;view_granite_light&quot; is on, walls will be colored in the same way. Turning this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.<dt>Use special colors for wall grids (view_granite_lite)<dd>If either the option &quot;view_yellow_light&quot; or &quot;view_bright_light&quot; is on, wall grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being gray. This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed, or if graphics are being used. Turning it off will slightly increase the speed of the game.<dt>Use special colors for floor grids (view_special_lite)<dd>If either the option &quot;view_yellow_light&quot; or &quot;view_bright_light&quot; is on, floor grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being black or white. This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for floors have been changed, or if graphics are being used. Turning it off will slightly increase the speed of the game.<dt>Map remembers all perma-lit grids (view_perma_grids)<dd>Memorize all permanently lit floor grids. Turning this option off allows you to know which lit floor grids are in line of sight. If you are using color, however, the &quot;view_bright_lite&quot; option works better.<dt>Map remembers all torch-lit grids (view_torch_grids)<dd>Memorize all floor grids that have ever been lit up by the player. This is one way to help keep track of which areas you have explored.</dl><h3 id="s1_3">Warning options</h3><dl><dt>Disturb whenever any monster moves (disturb_move)<dd><p>Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears, whether in line of sight or out of it. This increases safety, but may cause trouble when you have telepathy and are trying to rest.<dt>Disturb whenever viewable monster moves (disturb_near)<dd><p>Disturb the player when any viewable (visible and in direct line of sight) monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable, and whenever any viewable monster becomes no longer viewable.<p>It is recommended that you leave this option on; not doing so may cause you to be ambushed by monsters you can easily see.</dl><dl><dt>Disturb whenever map panel changes (disturb_panel)<dd>Disturbs you when the map panel shifts. This slows down your exploration, but makes it easier to avoid leaving a detected area.<dt>Disturb whenever player state changes (disturb_state)<dd>This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.<dt>Disturb whenever boring things happen (disturb_minor)<dd>Disturbs you when you sense wargear automatically (pseudo-ID), hear a door being bashed open, or begin to run out of fuel.<dt>Activate quick messages (quick_messages)<dd>Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the &quot;-more-&quot; prompt. Allows most keys to mean &quot;no&quot; to any &quot;[y/n]&quot; prompt. Usage of this option can be dangerous!<dt>Automatically clear &#39;-more-&#39; prompts (auto_more)<dd>The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more- prompt, but erases the message instead. This may speed up play, but can cause you to miss important warnings or interesting occurrences if you do not have an extra window devoted to message recall.<dt>Audible bell (on errors, etc) (ring_bell)<dd>Make a bell sound when errors occur (such as typing an invalid key).<dt>Flush input on various failures (flush_failure)<dd>This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros that include directional components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.<dt>Flush input whenever disturbed (flush_disturb)<dd>This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the character is disturbed. This is useful if you use macros that take time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a monster.</dl><h3 id="s1_4">Birth (difficulty) options</h3><p>You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.<dl><dt>Maximize effect of race/class bonuses (adult_maximize)<dd><p>If maximize mode is ON, racial and class adjustments to vital statistics (stat) act as permanent modifiers. A Dwarven priest will be able to raise his inherent wisdom to 18/150, but his intelligence only to 18/40.<p>Maximize mode makes races and classes play more differently, usually to the player&#39;s benefit; it is therefore recommended in most cases.</dl><dl><dt>Randomize some of the artifacts (alpha) (adult_randarts)<dd>Most of the artifacts will get random names and qualities. This can make for a fun change of pace.<dt>Auto-scum for good levels (birth_autoscum)<dd>Regenerates dungeon levels until one is found with enough dangerous monsters and nifty objects. Usage of this option makes for more intense but dangerous games.</dl><h4 id="s2_1">Ironman Play</h4><p>&quot;Go down into the dungeon. Return with Morgoth&#39;s Crown or not at all.&quot;<p>In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the surface by any means, until victorious. If by accident you do, you must immediately return to the dungeon.<p>Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it (&quot;crash-dive ironman&quot;), but they are variants on the basic theme.<dl><dt>Restrict the use of stairs/recall (adult_ironman)<dd>Can never go up. Can never use recall until you win the game. No stairs are ever placed under you when you change levels.<dt>Restrict the use of stores/home (adult_no_stores)<dd>Cannot use any stores or your home.<dt>Restrict creation of artifacts (adult_no_artifacts)<dd>No artifacts will appear.<dt>Don&#39;t stack objects on the floor (adult_no_stacking)<dd>The game normally allows many objects to stack in each floor grid. However, some people prefer the challenge of allowing only one object to appear in each floor grid. Turning this option on causes objects dropped by monsters to disappear if space is tight, and therefore encourages you to fight battles in wide-open spaces.<dt>Don&#39;t preserve artifacts when leaving level (adult_no_preserve)<dd>Turning this option on means that if you leave a level where there are artifacts present, then they disappear -- forever -- when you leave the level. However, you also get &quot;special&quot; level feelings when you enter a level so that you know when such artifacts are around.<dt>Don&#39;t generate connected stairs (birth_no_stairs)<dd>Most of the stairs in Angband are connected: if you go up, then you can go back down easily. Turning this option on, however, means that this is no longer guaranteed.</dl><h4 id="s2_2">Monster AI options</h4><dl><dt>Monsters chase current location (flow_by_sound)<dd>Allows monsters to navigate around obstacles between you and them.<dt>Monsters chase recent locations (flow_by_smell)<dd>Allows monsters to track you down by following your footsteps.</dl><p>Monsters act smarter in groups (v.slow) <a class="extlink" href="off">smart_packs</a> : Monster packs attempt to ambush the character. Monster groups are better at surrounding him.<dl><dt>Monsters learn from their mistakes (smart_learn)<dd>Allows monsters to learn about your resistances by observation, and to use this knowledge to avoid making further mistakes.<dt>Monsters exploit player&#39;s weaknesses (smart_cheat)<dd>Monsters instantly know all your resistances, and need spend no time learning.<dt>Monsters behave more intelligently (smart_monsters)<dd>Monsters choose spells depending on tactical situation (for example, they are more likely to use a healing spell when badly wounded). They breathe less often (sometimes much less often). They do not cast bolt spells if another monster blocks the way, and can find hiding places to run away to. However, this is a broken option at the moment: it makes the game more-or-less impossible.</dl><h3 id="s1_5">Cheat options</h3><p>Turning a cheating option on means that you will not appear in the hall of fame, and your character will be marked as a cheater.<dl><dt>Peek into object creation (cheat_peek)<dd>Cheaters never win. But they can peek at object creation.<dt>Peek into monster creation (cheat_hear)<dd>Cheaters never win. But they can peek at monster creation.<dt>Peek into dungeon creation (cheat_room)<dd>Cheaters never win. But they can peek at room creation.<dt>Know complete monster info (cheat_know)<dd>Cheaters never win. But they can know all about monsters.<dt>Allow player to avoid death (cheat_live)<dd>Cheaters never win. But they can cheat death.</dl><h3 id="s1_6">Subwindow display settings</h3><p>Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of useful information. The best thing about these windows is that they are (usually) updated automatically to reflect the current state of the world.<ul><li>inven/equip: Display the player inventory (and equipment).<li>equip/inven: Display the player equipment (and inventory).<li>player (basic): Display the main character screen.<li>player (extra): Display the character screen&#39;s equipment flags section.<li>messages: Display recent messages and notes.<li>overhead view: Display an overhead view of the dungeon.<li>monster recall: Display a description of the target monster.<li>object recall: Display a description of the most recently selected object. Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks.<li>status: replicates the bottom line of the main game terminal.<li>borg messages and status: Used for the automatic Angband player (the borg).</ul><h3 id="s1_7">Miscellaneous Options</h3><dl><dt>Hit point warning<dd>If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hit points (x10) at which you start to get special warnings. It is also used as the cut-off for using red to display both hit points and mana.<dt>Delay Factor<dd>The &quot;delay_factor&quot; value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks. The actual time delay is equal to &quot;delay_factor&quot; squared, in milliseconds. A value of five works well on many machines.<dt>Load a user pref file<dd>Reads user preferences (including options) from a file you choose. Normally used when preferences don&#39;t load automatically, and you want to rewrite them to a file that will.<dt>Append options to a file<dd>Saves options to file. See the below for help on what filename to use (the file &quot;user.prf&quot; usually works).</dl><p>Options are saved in your character&#39;s savefile, but you may want to use the same options for other characters too. Whenever you save options, you have essentially four choices of filenames:<ul><li><code>&lt;savefile name&gt;.prf</code> affects only that character<li><code>&lt;race name&gt;.prf</code> affects all characters of that race<li><code>&lt;class name&gt;.prf</code> affects all characters of that class<li><code>user.prf</code> affects all of your characters</ul><p>These rules also apply to other kinds of preferences.</div></div>
