<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">Pages to be Written</h3><ul><li>Buying and Selling (how to work out values of items, and effects of shopkeepers)<li>Digging<li>DisplayOptions (including comparison of different graphic symbol sets)<li>Enemies to Be Fought<li>FoodAndDrink<li>Illumination (include cumulative effects of light-giving items)<li>Magic<li>MB(x)<li>Resistances<li>Speed<li>Spellbooks</ul><h3 id="s1_2">Things to Do</h3><ul><li>Update everything written so far to 3.1.0<li>Add a title masthead, using coloured table cells, to each page<li>Add a warning masthead to top of spoiler pages<li>Do navigation for subpages<li>Now I&#39;ve figured out in-page anchors, do the glossary links.</ul><h3 id="s1_3">Old Page Text</h3><p><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/OldText">OldText</a> (Old Text)<h3 id="s1_4">Ideas</h3><p>Once the information part of the manual is written, we can think about doing some strategy, tactics and tips. What needs to be done is offer advice from the POV of different playing styles. One thought I have is to do a walkthrough, starting from character generation, and explaining why I made certain choices, and then getting people to comment from their perspectives as to why what I did was wrong (!) or right. After character generation I&#39;d explain what equipment I bought; and then the choices I made during each stage of dungeon adventuring. This would involve some save-scumming as I will undoubtedly die several times!<p>There should be a page on how to modify or patch the info, e.g. add or change creatures, or magic item flavours, etc..<p>Need to add info on graphics for items and monsters - for all graphic sets.<h3 id="s1_5">Unanswered Questions</h3><ol type="1"><li>Need confirmation that Mordenkainen, Tenser and Kelek come from <i>D&amp;D</i>, and Raal from <i>Betrayal in Antara</i><li>What are Scarabtarices? (or is it a character name, too?)<li>Why is the Ring of Lightning 5000gp when the other three elemental rings are 3000, and all four have completely parallel stats?</ol><p>This question is now moot, since 3.1.1 completely changes the basis of item pricing.<ol type="1"><li>Ammunition of Slay Evil and of Venom cannot be Mithril; why not? Every other sort of ego-item ammunition can be</ol><p>Slay Evil because it would make killing Morgoth too easy (Holy Might is <i>much</i> rarer). No idea about Venom - probably just an oversight (it&#39;s a rubbish brand anyway).<ol type="1"><li>Which attributes of artifacts and ego-items need *Identify * rather than Identify?</ol><p>This question is also moot, since 3.1.1 completely changes the basis of ID (in fact <b>ID</b> was removed in 3.1.0). The answer was anything other than pvals needed <b>ID</b>.<h3 id="s1_6">Questions Answered but not Updated into the Manual Yet</h3><ol type="1"><li>Rarity - how does that work, then?<li>Does Phase Door have a propensity to transport you away from the current room? It seems that I end up in an adjacent room more often than not<li>Phase Door and Teleport &#150; when the distances are referred to as &#39;up to&#39;, what exactly does that mean?<li>Why is the armour Bladeturner [50, +35], and not [40, +45], when normal power dragon scale mail is [40, +15]<li>What does &#39;drain_exp&#39; do, exactly?</ol><h3 id="s1_7">Notes</h3><p>My approach to (re)writing the manual is that there are four types of information:<ul><li>flavour (descriptive info which may be vague, at times intentionally): for example, a description of the nature of powerful magic weapons (artifacts and ego items)<li>useful information for playing the game: for example, information on how to understand the bonuses on magical weapons<li>detailed but openly available information: e.g. how to calculate damage dealt in combat<li>detailed, hidden information: e.g. a complete list of all artifacts and their attributes</ul><p>Older notes<ul><li>We need to work in a section on squelching<li>Player Preferences needs revising - for instance interacting with visuals is no longer a command in its own right.<li>It would be nice to work in parts of the <a class="extlink" href="http://www.thangorodrim.net/TANG/index.html">Angband Newbie Guide</a> as well, though that would probably also require some updating.</ul></div></div>
