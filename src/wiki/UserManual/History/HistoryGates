<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">The Gates of Hell</h3><p>The result was a shiny new release, Angband 2.9.0.<p>And with the greater amount of user-customizability that is now possible, it was inevitable that somebody would eventually go and actually do something with it. Jonathan Ellis started customizing the user-editable text files in the &quot;edit&quot; directory for his own personal use - originally, only by fixing bugs and inconsistencies (less powerful monsters being worthmore experience per kill than more powerful ones, dragons doing a decent amount of damage in melee, monsters with two claws and one mouth getting one claw and three bite attacks, and so on).<p>At first, this was all that could really be done with it: adding new monsters and items was impossible, as the limits were fixed. And so only three new monsters made an appearance, each of them replacing an existing monster, and one new artifact was introduced: &quot;The Palantir of Westernesse&quot;. Gameplay balance could be tweaked somewhat, by changing the level, power and rarity of certain items and monsters: and some changes were made, mostly with the attempt to reduce the notorious &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect of needing poison, confusion and nether resistance (or over 550 HP, if without nether resistance) all at once, straight after passing 2000&#39;, forcing excessive scumming before this depth or risking unavoidable instant death: and then having nothing left to do but dive straight to 4000&#39; and scum for speed items, missing out on some of the most interesting depths of the dungeon. This problem, at least, could be addressed, but actual new things were less easy to add...<p>That all changed with Angband 2.9.1, which for the first time moved the limits themselves to a separate user-editable file, and allowed more monsters and items to be created without removing the old ones. At the same time, a patch by Matthias Kurzke was incorporated which allowed the creation of new ego-items. Various new powers, for the player and monsters, were added to the game - but no items or monsters yet had these powers (resist fear, poison brand, lose charisma, summon greater demons, and so on): indeed, arguably it could be said that the game had not even adjusted properly to Ben Harrison&#39;s fractional speed system (Angband 2.7.0) or the addition of the other attack forms such as shards, sound, chaos, nexus and so on (even before Ben).<p>Angband 2.9.3 was the last official release before a series of beta-releases, from 2.9.4 to 2.9.7, which made various changes, most notably reordering the spell list and introducing a scripting language, Lua.<p>For Angband 2.9.0, the first few new visible features were a random artifact generator (originally developed from a variant by Greg Wooledge), an option to improve monster AI (believed to have originally started out life in a patch written by Keldon Jones), and a patch to allow easier handling of opening and closing doors and disarming traps (by Tim Baker). For Angband 2.9.1 has also come such things as the ability to increase the size of the editable textfiles and thus the number of monsters, artifacts, items, ego-items and vaults in the game (many new vaults were written by Chris Weisiger, some by others, and the number of vaults in the game at this time was doubled), and much greater customizability of ego-items has become possible thanks to a patch written by Matthias Kurzke. It is also now possible to add new character races to the game, and to edit the shopkeepers with respect to their greed, tolerance of haggling and reactions to the character based on his race. Angband 2.9.2 adds support for poison branded weapons to the game. Angband 2.9.3 made the character class itself customizable to an extent. Angband 3.0.6, on 18th June 2005, was RR9&#39;s last release. He stepped down 5th March, 2006.</div></div>
