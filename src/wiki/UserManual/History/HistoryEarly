<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">The Early Days</h3><p>First came Moria, in 1985, by Robert Alan Koeneke. This was ported to Unix in 1989 by James E Wilson and hence became &quot;Umoria&quot; (Unix Moria).<p>Details about the history of the various flavors of &quot;Moria&quot;, the direct ancestor to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan Koeneke is included below. Moria has been ported to a variety of platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.<p>In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students at the University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing code for Umoria 5.2.1. They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even strengthening the grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters and items, including unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation, pseudo-sensing, level feelings, and special dungeon rooms.<p>Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill and others, worked on the source, culminating in the first public release of Angband, &quot;Angband 2.4.frog_knows&quot; in April 1993. It ran only on Unix, but there were many ports to other platforms (especially Macs and PCs). The PC port (for DOS) was written by Charles Teague, and unlike today&#39;s ports, he made changes to the game whilst porting. Many (but not all) of the changes in PC Angband 1.4 became incorporated back into the main game around version 2.6.<h3 id="s1_2">A Posting from the Original Author</h3><p>From: koeneke@ionet.net (Robert Alan Koeneke)<br />Newsgroups: rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria<br />Subject: Early history of Moria<br />Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT<p>I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its relation to Rogue. So I thought I would just post some text on the early days of Moria.<p>First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first Moria. I had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and such. I just recently connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the dark ages where Internet is concerned) and was real surprised to find Moria in the news groups... Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I have never seen it. I probably spoke to its originator though... I have given permission to lots of people through the years to enhance, modify, or whatever as long as they freely distributed the results. I have always been a proponent of sharing games, not selling them.<p>Anyway...<p>Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University of Oklahoma. The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version of UNIX. I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get to know the system administrators. They invited me one night to stay and play some games, an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure (later just &#39;Adventure&#39;), and late one night, a new dungeon game called &#39;Rogue&#39;.<p>So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye. In fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play time wasted on Moria and its descendents...<p>Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a different department as a student assistant in computers. I worked on one of the early VAX 11/780&#39;s running VMS, and no games were available for it at that time. The engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who thought the only purpose of a computer was WORK! Imagine... Soooo, no more games, and no more rogue!<p>This was intolerable! So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta 1.0. I had three languages available on my VMS system. Fortran IV, PASCAL V1.?, and BASIC. Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote the first attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue, at least what I could remember of it. Then I began getting ideas of how to improve it, how it should work differently, and I pretty much didn&#39;t touch it for about a year.<p>Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its recognizable form. I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for THAT is to work so hard you can&#39;t think about it; and I was enrolled for fall to take an operating systems class in PASCAL.<p>So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a new feature. Variable length strings! Wow...<p>That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL. I learned more about data structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in all of my years in school. I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria players... All at OU.<p>I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born. Jimmey helped out on many of the functions in the game as well. This would have been about Moria 2.0<p>In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept making enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and to keep them going. If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and &#39;enhanced&#39; the game to make it harder. I once vowed it was &#39;unbeatable&#39;, and a week later a friend of mine beat it! His character, &#39;Iggy&#39;, was placed into the game as &#39;The Evil Iggy&#39;, and immortalized... And of course, I went in and plugged up the trick he used to win...<p>Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities. Just before a OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the Univeristy of Texas... I couldn&#39;t resist... I modified it so that the begger on the town level was &#39;An OU football fan&#39; and they moved at maximum rate. They also multiplied at maximum rate... So the first step you took and woke one up, it crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of them and pounded you into oblivion... I soon received a call and provided instructions on how to &#39;de-enhance&#39; the game!<p>Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release. I was working on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines (and yes, I still work there). Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and contained many neat enhancements, features, you name it.<p>It had water, streams, lakes, pools, with water monsters. It had &#39;mysterious orbs&#39; which could be carried like torches for light but also gave off magical aura&#39;s (like protection from fire, or aggrivate monster...). It had new weapons and treasures... I left it with the student assistants at OU to be finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine. As far as I know, that source was lost...<p>I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game. Several people asked if they could convert it to &#39;C&#39;, and I said fine as long as a complete credit history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold, only given. So I guess one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to rewrite it in &#39;C&#39;.<p>I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from players telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the day I was born... I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it was still standing) talking about the game on VAX&#39;s (which supposedly couldn&#39;t be there due to export laws). I used to have a map with pins for every letter I received, but I gave up on that!<p>I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going... I plan to download it and Angband and play them... Maybe something has been added that will surprise me! That would be nice... I never got to play Moria and be surprised...<p>Robert Alan Koeneke<p>koeneke@ionet.net</div></div>
