<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h4 id="s2_1">The (Extended) Character Screen</h4><p>During the game, you can return to view the <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/CharacterScreen">character screen</a> for a full view of your character&#39;s information, by pressing C (Shift-c). The character screen shows essentially the same information as before, but with one slight change and some additional options that weren&#39;t relevant when generating the character, and a second screen of detailed information.<p>The change is that the Cost column for stats is no longer shown, as the stats are now set.<p>The three additional options are listed below the character&#39;s background description, and are:<ul><li><b>c</b> - Change the character&#39;s name. Press this key and you can type a new name in; as at the start you can press <b>*</b> for a random name. Press Enter to accept a new name, or Esc to exit and retain the current name.<li><b>f</b> - Create a file (known as a <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/Glossary">character dump</a>) which contains details of your character, stats, status and equipment. The file is a text file with the name of your character (e.g. Frodo.txt), and will be created (by default) in the \lib\user subfolder within the Angband folder. The name and location are shown before creation, and can be changed.<li><b>h</b> - This option allows you to access the extended part of the character screen, and toggles back and forth between the two screens.</ul><p>The new screen shows the same information at top left (name, sex, etc..) and top right (stats) as on the original screen.<p>Top centre, there is a rectangular grid of dots with six rows and thirteen columns. The columns are labelled with the twelve letters a-l, and the @ sign. The grid shows any effects that magical equipment items may have on character stats. The rows correspond to the six character stats, and the letters correspond to the <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/InventoryAndEquipment">equipment slots</a>. Below the letters are shown characters or graphics for any items of equipment you have, as on the status indicators on the main game screen.<p>So for example, if your character&#39;s missile weapon (slot <b>b</b>) gave a bonus to Dexterity, the dot at the intersection of the fourth row and second column would be replaced with an appropriate indicator, as described below. The @ column shows inherent abilities of your character, e.g. Dunadan have the inherent ability of sustaining constitution, so this is shown in this column.<p>A dark green letter <b>s</b> shows that that equipment item sustains that characteristic. Sustained characteristics are more resistant to reduction by magical means or monster attacks.<p>A bright green number shows that the equipment item increases the stat by that amount.<p>A dark green number shows that the equipment item both increases the stat and sustains it.<p>A dark red number shows that the equipment item decreases the stat.<p>Below this are four similar grids showing effects from equipment, including resistances<a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/Resistances">?</a> to attacks and other ability bonuses. A <b>+</b> sign indicates the relevant ability or resistance is present; a <b>*</b> indicates that the equipment item confers immunity rather than resistance.<p>The rows are as follows:<table border="1"><tr><td>Acid</td><td>Resistance to Acid attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Elec</td><td>Resistance to Electrical or Lightning-based attacksResistance to</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>Resistance to Fire attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Cold</td><td>Resistance to Cold attacks</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><b><i>(Note: these four are known as the basic resistances)</i></b></td></tr><tr><td>Pois</td><td>Resistance to Poison and Poison-based attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Fear</td><td>Resistance to fear (spells or abilities that render your character magically afraid and hence unable to attack with a melee weapon).</td></tr><tr><td>Lite</td><td>Resistance to Light attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Dark</td><td>Resistance to Dark attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Blind</td><td>Resistance to attacks or spells that cause blindness (a blind character cannot cast spells, and has a reduced chance of hitting with attacks)</td></tr><tr><td>Confu</td><td>Resistance to attacks or spells that cause confusion (a confused character cannot cast spells, and moves randomly)</td></tr><tr><td>Sound</td><td>Resistance to sound attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Shard</td><td>Resistance to shard attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Nexus</td><td>Resistance to nexus attacks (which can cause random teleports, or randomisation of character stats)</td></tr><tr><td>Nethr</td><td>Resistance to nether attacks (which can drain experience)</td></tr><tr><td>Chaos</td><td>Resistance to chaos attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Disen</td><td>Resistance to disenchantment</td></tr><tr><td>S.
