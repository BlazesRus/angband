<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_1">More About Your Character</h3><h4 id="s2_1">Status and Other Information</h4><p>While playing the game, you will need to know at a glance your character&#39;s current status: how wounded is he or she? How capable of casting an important spell? How much experience is needed to reach the next level? And so on.</div><hr /><div class="page"><h4 id="s2_2">Status Indicators</h4><p>At the top left of the game display there is a quick reference to some of the important stats and status indicators you will need to know about. Many of these replicate information from the <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/CharacterScreen">character screen</a>, which you can also view during the game (see below), and which now contains much more information.<p>Reading down from the top you will see (with explanations of new or differently described items):<table border="1"><tr><td>Race</td><td>Your character&#39;s race. (<a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/Races">See Races</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Class</td><td>Your character&#39;s class. (<a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/Classes">See Classes</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>This is a cosmetic title that begins humbly, but becomes increasing impressive as your character advances in experience levels. The titles are also based on the class of your character.</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>The current experience level of your character, based on the amount of experience accrued. The Level will be a number in the range of 1 to 50, and will be displayed in yellow if your character has been afflicted by an experience draining effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Nxt</td><td>The number of experience points your character needs to advance to the next experience level (the difference between Cur Exp and Adv Exp on the Character Screen). This number will be displayed in yellow if your character has been afflicted by an experience draining effect. On reaching level 50 this status indicator will change to display the current amount of experience for your character.</td></tr><tr><td>AU</td><td>The amount of gold your character has in their purse (it can be a pretty big purse later in the game!)</td></tr><tr><td>Equipment Icons</td><td>A series of icons showing what your character has in their equipment list. The characters from left to right represent the slots a to l, and empty slots are represented by spaces.</td></tr><tr><td>Stats</td><td>All six stats are shown in order, in green text if they are currently at the character&#39;s normal level, and in yellow if reduced by some means. The stat abbreviation is in upper case if at normal level (e.g. DEX), in mixed case (e.g. Dex) if reduced, and followed by an exclamation mark if at the maximum possible (e.g DEX! not DEX:)</td></tr><tr><td>Cur AC</td><td>Current armour class</td></tr><tr><td>HP</td><td>Hit points, showing your character&#39;s current and maximum hit points separated by a slash</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>Spell points, also showing current and maximum values separated by a slash</td></tr><tr><td>Monster status</td><td>When in hand-to-hand combat with a creature, or when your character has targeted a creature, a simple guide to that monster&#39;s health is shown here as a row of asterisks within square brackets, i.e. [**********]. As a creature becomes more wounded, asterisks are replaced with dashes, from right to left, e.g. [*******---]. The colour of the asterisks gives more information on the status of the creature (see <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/StatusCodes">Status Display Details</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Wounds</td><td>Certain monsters have attacks that as well as reducing hit points, can also cause wounds. Wounds, like poison, cause continuing damage every turn, but themselves reduce in severity over a number of turns. The graduated wound descriptions are shown at <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/StatusCodes">Status Display Details</a>. This space can also show the <b>Stun</b> flag, a temporary condition which reduces your character&#39;s combat ability.</td></tr></table><p>Note that both hit points and spells points are shown in green when at maximum, in yellow when below maximum, and red when at zero (Damage in Angband is shown in whole numbers, but actually calculated to several decimal places, so it is possible for a character to be shown at 0 hit points, but still be alive; not for long, as a rule, however).</div><hr /><div class="page"><h4 id="s2_3">Status Flags</h4><p>Another information zone is the bottom line of the screen; this is where a number of character status flags are shown. Only one - the depth (or dungeon level) your character is at - is initially shown. Reading from left to right, the status flags are as follows:<table border="1"><tr><td>Hunger</td><td>Shows how much your character needs sustenance. When adequately fed, this flag space will be blank, otherwise it will show whether the character is sated or feeling hungry. A very hungry character can faint and become paralysed, and is in imminent danger of death from starvation. See <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/StatusCodes">Status Display Details</a> for the graduated descriptions.</td></tr><tr><td>Blind</td><td>A character can be blinded by setting off certain traps, by magical attack or by some monsters that attack with light or dark. While blind, spells cannot be cast and it is much more difficult to fight effectively.</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>A character can be confused or made amnesiac by setting off certain traps or by magical attack. Confusion prevents the casting of spells and makes your character&#39;s attacks random; amnesia may be temporary or permanent, and means a character forgets all or some abilities of equipment and magical items.</td></tr><tr><td>Afraid</td><td>A character afflicted by fear, normally as a result of a spell or ability of monster, is unable to make melee attacks, but is able to shoot, throw, cast spells/prayers and use magical devices and artifacts.</td></tr><tr><td>Poisoned</td><td>A character can be poisoned by setting off certain traps or by being bitten or stung by poison-carrying creatures. Poison will wear off after a time, but while poisoned, your character will take damage every turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Searching</td><td>Shows if your character is in permanent search mode. Search mode remains active until disabled or if certain events occur - such as a monster becoming visible or leaving the player&#39;s vision, or if the player interacts with monsters - typically attacking or being attacked.</td></tr><tr><td>Paralyzed!</td><td>This flag appears in the same location as Searching, above; a character can be paralysed by setting off certain traps or by attacks from certain creatures. Paralysis wears off eventually but your character can do nothing while paralysed, and if under attack by a creature with a paralysing ability, repeated paralysis can lead to death swiftly.</td></tr><tr><td>Speed</td><td>If your character is moving faster or slower than normal speed, this flag will either show Slow (in brown) or Fast (in bright green), with respectively a negative or positive number in parentheses to show how much slower or fast they are moving.</td></tr><tr><td>Study</td><td>For spell-using characters, the Study flag shows that experience gained means they can learn one or more additional spells. Study will list the number of spells/prayers that the player can learn, and this is based on their intellect (for magic users) or wisdom (for users of prayers). Whether or not your character can actually learn additional spells is also reliant on your character possessing a spell/prayer book containing spells appropriate to their experience level.</td></tr><tr><td>Depth</td><td>This shows the depth within the dungeon your character is currently at. Initially, it shows <b>Town</b>. Within the dungeon, it can either show a level number (e.g. Level 19) or a depth (e.g. 950&#39;), depending on an option flag you can set (see <a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/GameOptions">Game Options</a>).</td></tr><tr><td>Acid</td><td>This flag is shown (in grey) if you have a temporary resistance to Acid attacks, obtained via a spell or other magical means. Permanent resistance (obtained from wielding a powerful magic weapon or wearing magic armour) does not show here)</td></tr><tr><td>Elec</td><td>This flag is shown (in blue) if you have a temporary resistance to electrical, or lightning, attacks. See the Acid flag, above, for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>This flag is shown (in red) if you have a temporary resistance to fire attacks. See the Acid flag, above, for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>Cold</td><td>This flag is shown (in white) if you have a temporary resistance to cold attacks. See the Acid flag, above, for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>Pois</td><td>This flag is shown (in dark green) if you have a temporary resistance to poison attacks. See the Acid flag, above, for more information.</td></tr></table></div><hr /><div class="page"><table border="1"><tr><th align="center" width="33%">Previous Page</th><th width="33%">Up</th><th align="center" width="33%">Next Page</th></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/InventoryAndEquipment">Equipping Your Character</a></td><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual">Index</a></td><td align="center"><a href="http://rephial.org/wiki/UserManual/ExtendedCharacterScreen">The Extended Character Screen</a></td></tr></table></div></div>
