The &quot;to hit&quot; calculations need a lot more work than the damage ones, which seems to be a good system with variety and a system relatively easy to balance.<h4 id="s2_2">Damage calculation</h4><p>Armour (and skin) has a rating for its resistance to cutting damage and another for its resistance to blunt damage.<p>The rating represents the amount of damage not absorbed - i.e. a rating of 0 indicated total imperviousness to damage of that sort. 100 indicated that it doesn&#39;t absorb any damage at all.<p>Skin and armour ratings can be combined by multiplying the ratings together and dividing by 100. (Division could be left until the end if it speeds up the algorithm.)<p>For example: Monster has skin ratings of (30, 50) and wears an armour of (50, 50). Its total ratings would be (30*50)/100 = 15 and (50*50)/100 = 25. Only 15% of cutting damage would get through, but 25% of crushing damage would get through.<p>As such, weapons would need a cutting value and a crushing value. This could be expressed as a ratio of curring:crushing, or as two seperate numbers, depending on what is easiest/quickest/best. It could be done as two damage ratings, expressed as (2d2:3d6), though this may be too complex or hard to balance.<p>It may be desirable to include a modifier for the &quot;accuracy&quot; of a hit, so that a glancing blow would do 10% damage, a proper hit would do 100%. This can be determined as part of the to-hit calculations.<p>Another option is including a modifier for the strength of the person wielding the weapon and the speed of the attack. This could be calculated in the hit calculation along wih the &quot;glancing blow&quot; calculation, leading to e.g. 20% damage for a glancing blow and 200% for a direct hit.<p>Thus an armour description would be a pair of values (xx, xx), and a weapon description would also have a pair of values and hit dice (&quot;2d4 (80, 20)&quot;), a pair of hit dice (&quot;(2d4, 2d2)&quot;), or hit dice and a ratio (&quot;2d4 (4:1)&quot;).<h4 id="s2_3">&quot;Hit&quot; calculation</h4><p>Factors: dexterity on both sides, speed on both sides (encumberance?), skill level?, &quot;their&quot; weapon&#39;s defensive properties, &quot;your&quot; weapon&#39;s attacking properties.<p>Some algorithm which, if everything is equal, produces two identical values. If attack &gt; defence, the attack has &quot;landed&quot; to some extent. if attack &gt; 2*defense, it is a good hit, attack &gt; 4*defence, exceptional? some sort of scale here.</div></div>
