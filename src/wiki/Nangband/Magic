They can use everything without trouble, but have a fairly low cap on strength and constitution.<p>Second level classes are Rangers and &lt;something else&gt;. These have a slightly more restricted choice of spells, and have a higher cap on constitution and strength, respectively.<p>Third level classes are Rogues and Paladins. They have a very restricted set of spells, but suffer no penalties related to their magic-using abilities. (They have their own advantages/disadvantages.)<p>Only first and second level classes can do things like authoring scrolls, or spellbooks (if allowed). The various levels also start off with different amounts of magical knowledge; each level, for example, starts off with knowledge of some randomly-selected herbs - Magic-users will know more at the beginning of the game than others.</div><hr /><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_2">Spell systems</h3><h4 id="s2_1">Possiblity: a &quot;preference&quot; system</h4><p>This is quite an old thought.<p>All magic-users get to use the first two books (&quot;compendiums&quot;) of basic spells useful to everyone - universal utility spells need identifying for these. Each compendium would need to be pretty chunky (10 spells each?). There are also high-level, randomly created spellbooks, which contain spells not found in the compendiums (reasoning: dead magic-users will have had their own selections of spells).<p>At character birth, the player makes a preference as to when various types of magic will become available to them. This means they put however many divisions there are in order, top to bottom. The first choice will also grant the spellcaster certain benefits.<p>Old thinking on divisions:<p>escaping (+5 stealth)<ul><li>blink<li>armour<li>dimension door<li>shift levels</ul><p>divining (see invis)<ul><li>detection<li>know item<li>magic mapping</ul><p>summoning<ul><li>bring food<li>summon item<li>summon elementals<li>summon destruction<li>&quot;summoning&quot; fire/frozt bolts...</ul></div><hr /><div class="page"><h3 id="s1_3">Thoughts on new spells</h3><h4 id="s2_2">Priestly spells</h4><dl><dt>Holy light<dd>Only works if room is black.
