<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>Angband is a very old game, with support for many systems that are no longer used, and inadequate support for some that are... this page is an attempt to fix that. Please list the approximate specs of all the systems you want to run Angband on, especially the more unusual or marginal ones. Angband variants count, as the place to make portability hacks is generally in V.<h3 id="s1_1">Systems That Should Stay Supported</h3><ul><li>i386, 5GB disk, FreeBSD 7.0, 100M RAM -- StefanORear&#39;s BSD portability testing virtual machine<li>i386, 80GB, Linux 2.6 / GNU toolchain, 386M -- StefanORear&#39;s development/gaming system<li>i386 OpenBSD<li>i386 and PPC OS X 10.3.9+ -- test machines available are MacBook, OS X 10.5; G4 iBook, OS X 10.5<li>PPC OS X 10.3.0+ -- build flag &quot;ppc&quot;, test machine available is G4 iBook 10.3.9</ul><h3 id="s1_2">Systems That Should Become Supported</h3><p>Please explain why they don&#39;t work, and give enough information for developers to contact you for testing.<h3 id="s1_3">Systems That Developers Want To Drop</h3><p>If you have one of these and want to continue playing Angband on it, move it to the first list.</div></div>
