<div id="wikicontent"><div class="page"><p>Please read this page if you&#39;re contributing to the game, by writing patches, reporting bugs, or using the issue tracker.<p>For proposed changes:<ul><li>feature / gameplay changes should be discussed on the forum / r.g.r.a first<li>code-level changes should be discussed in angband-dev or on IRC first</ul><p>Tickets should:<ul><li>have clear titles<li>include a link to relevant forum threads<li>have clear criteria for marking them as closed<li>be assigned to the milestone you intend to work on it by (for features), or the next milestone (for bugs)<li>be updated with any related commit numbers, by adding a comment with &quot;in r425&quot; or &quot;partially in &quot;r466&quot; in it (eventually this will be automatic)</ul><p>Patches should:<ul><li>be attached to a relevant bug on the tracker, or sent to angband-dev<li>be in unified diff format and preferably be against SVN trunk (&quot;<code>svn diff</code>&quot;) or the latest public release (&quot;<code>diff -u</code>&quot;).<li>follow the CodingGuidelines</ul><p>If the patch is a bugfix, then you can reasonably expect it to be integrated into the development tree pretty quickly. If it&#39;s more involved, and the feature is not one that the next version is planned to have, the patch may go through several reviews before being incorporated. It may also just be unsuitable for Angband&#151;in which case, please don&#39;t take rejection badly; you may just be better off writing a variant.<p>Commits should:<ul><li>compile<li>happen early and often<li>be as standalone as possible<li>have messages which reference bug numbers they relate to in parentheses at the front of the message, like &quot;(#34) Imported new savefile code&quot;</ul></div></div>
