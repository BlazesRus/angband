=== Instructions for using Angband 2.7.X with OS/2 ===

The patches (file "main-emx.c") to compile Angband 2.7.X under OS/2
were written by ekraemer@pluto.nasim.cube.net (Ekkehard "Ekkie" Kraemer).

- TO COMPILE:

    * untar the archive into /angband (or /games/angband or whatever)
    * change directory to /angband/src
    * rename Makefile-emx to Makefile
    * run dmake (not gmake or make)
    * change directory to /angband
    * start angband.exe

- I used EMX 0.9a, but every EMX compiler since 0.8g or so should work
  fine. EMX is available at ftp-Os2.cdrom.com ("Hobbes"), as is dmake.

- You MUST start Angband with the -u switch and supply your character's (!)
  name because otherwise it won't find your savefile. If you're not sure
  how you named your character, look at lib/save/.  This may change...
