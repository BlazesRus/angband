 longtitle="A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation." \
 description="Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon \
 simulation derived from the game Moria, which was in turn based on \
 Rogue. It is often described as a 'roguelike' game because the look \
 and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue. \
 Angband features many enhancements over Moria: unique foes, \
 artifacts, monster pits and vaults to name a few. Many of these new \
 creatures and objects are drawn from the writings of J.R.R Tolkien, \
 although some of the monsters come straight from classical mythology, \
 Dungeons & Dragons, Rolemaster, or the minds of the orginal Angband \
 coders. \
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough \
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so, \
 you will receive the exalted status of 'winner' and your character \
 may retire. \
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's 'prison of iron.' \
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He \
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, 'god' of J.R.R. \
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears \
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does \
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read \
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of \
 Middle-Earth." \
