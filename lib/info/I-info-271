===== Angband 2.7.1 ===== 1/18/95 =====

I have just uploaded "Angband 2.7.1" to ftp.cis.ksu.edu.

The following files were placed into /pub/upload:
  angband-271-readme           <== This file
  angband-271.tar.gz           <== The Unix version
  angband-271-mac.sea.hqx      <== The Macintosh version
  angband-271-mac-src.sea.hqx  <== The Macintosh "source"


Note that the "lib" directory has changed slightly.  As always, be sure
to thorw out any "*.raw" files in the "data" directory before using the
new version.  Previous savefiles should still be compatible.


Note that for the Macintosh, you may acquire EITHER the "executable" system
(not very useful for developement) or the "full developement folder", which
includes the source, the "lib" folder, and Think C 6.0 project/resource files.


To compile for a standard Unix machine, extract the given "angband" directory,
and move it to somewhere useful (the program assumes "/tmp" by default).  Go
into the "src" directory, and modify "h-config.h" to reflect your "system"
(no changes are necessary for most Sun machines), "config.h" to reflect your
"game preferences" and "Makefile" to reflect your "compilation preferences".
Then, type "make depend", and then "make".  Let me know what compilation
problems present themselves, there will probably be some...

To compile for use with X11, follow the instructions above, but first do
"mv Makefile Makefile-cur; mv Makefile-x11 Makefile".


To compile for a Macintosh (using Think C 6.0), acquire and extract the
"Angband 2.7.1 Source" folder, open the "Angband" project, and choose
"update project", followed by "build application".  Note that "Angband
2.7.1" has a new preference file layout, as well as a new "bundle bits",
so you may want to (at least temporarily) remove older versions from
the hard drive.


Anyone interested in "graphics modules" for various systems should
contact me, I may be able to put you in touch with someone already
working on the problem.  Take a look at "main-mac.c" for a "clean"
way to adapt to a new "system".


Send comments/patches to "benh@linc.cis.upenn.edu", or post to the
"rec.games.rouguelike.angband" newsgroup.
