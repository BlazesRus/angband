Background
==========
Version 2.7.2 was released on 12 February 1995, as part of Ben Harrison's massive rewriting and cleanup effort.  Once again, it consisted mostly of bugfixes and "behind the scenes" improvements, and was intended to provide a stable point for which platform-specific parts could be written.  Previously, these parts of the code were undergoing as many changes from week to week as the rest of the new sections, so people trying to port to the Amiga, say, were finding it hard to keep up.

In addition to these, however, there were many small changes to the behaviour of stores, and one or two notable gameplay changes.  These included the introduction of the \*Identify\* scroll to try and reduce the need for sources outside of the game such as spoilers in order to learn about the things in it.  This release also stopped use of ammunition as weaponry (so it was no longer possible to attack creatures by hand with a high-powered arrow).
