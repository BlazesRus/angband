Background
==========
2.5.3 was released on 10th January 1994, as part of Charles Swiger's quickfire 2.5 series of releases. This was the first release Charles considered stable, rather than beta-quality.

Changelist
==========
Features
--------
 - Improved on the line of sight/in_bounds code to make it faster.
 - Tweaked the recall monster code some.
 - Added support for HPUX thanks to Chris Ang.
 - Sped up the code some (by macroizing some stuff).
 - Switched description of "the Ring of Power" to "the One Ring".
 - Added support for Ultrix thanks to Eugene Hung.
 - Moved the gender code into the creature_list array and reordered the descriptions so that desc_list[i] = c_list[i], this was a pain, but I caught a few more inconsistencies doing so.
 - Anduril is now "The Longsword 'Anduril'", thanks J.Kewley.
 - Added an option "plain_descriptions" so that items will be displayed without their 'flavor' if that's what the user prefers.
 - Modified object creation so that it makes objects at the average of the dun_level and the creature's level.
 - Added flag for haggling rather than a compile-time define.
 - Touched up a few artifacts (Beleg C. -> Belthronding), Sting vs. Weapon of Westernesse, made artifacts display a little more info (searching, infra)
 - Moved Master Mystics to dun_level 50.
 - Redid some of the object description code to give more informative messages and to avoid some braindamage.
 - Added option to display weight for equipment list (seperate from inven list) because new descriptions can be longer and will overrun the available space.
 - Made monsters resist damage from weapons a little better.
 - Large kobolds resist poison too.
 - Made pits not activate the "special" message but vaults will.
 - Improved HPUX support (thanks to Chris Ang)

Bugfixes
--------
 - Fixed a typo giving Bladeturner +305 to AC (thanks DGK).
 - Fixed some code that fails on K&R compilers, and reorganized the static prototypes so they'll do some good for non-ANSI compilers.
 - Fixed 'screen too small for moria' message to read 'Angband'.
 - Turned down the delays a little.
 - Worked around the 'infamous monster heal bug', when restoring savefiles.
 - Fixed a few more monster descriptions (made worm mass descriptions consistent).
 - Fixed 'Set of Cestus' to 'Set of Cesti'.
 - Reindented the whole set of source code; use 4-2 indenting & a 90 col editor reindentation has revealed some questionable syntax RE: '=&' vs '= &' which may have caused some subtle bugs.
 - Fixed monsters running away due to '= -' versus '-='.
 - Fixed up some of the library files.
 - Fixed some bugs in the util.c for supporting microsleep on those machines that need it.
 - Fixed possibly letting character go up and down stairs first 100 turns and get feelings each time.
 - Made see invisible never auto-detect, as this is not worth fixing right.
 - Fixed keypad wizard commands (made 'em the save as the rogue wizard commands).
 - Fixed a few more '= -' expressions.
 - Fixed a bug in the wizard level identify code.
 - Fixed Makefile bug ".o.c" versus ".c.o".
 - Fixed unique deaths not being recalled if you can't see them when they die.
 - Patched a few more non-ANSI-compiler problems, & min/max.
 - Fixed teleporting leaving lighted area with wide-area light.
 - Fixed a possible lighting bug (casting light spell with light item), and made unlighting a little more impressive.
 - Fixed overlong inscriptions (thanks grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu).
 - Fixed minor misspellings.
 - Tried to fix up some minor lighting errors; also touched up a monster or two.
 - Fixed object descriptions displaying the p1 value inappropriately (+x).
 - Removed LINT_ARG define so that we always get function prototypes.
 - Tweaked the Makefile some more (make clean does better now).
 - Removed need for -fwritable-strings [TL].
 - Added const char * declarations all over the place (very painful); note that the player ghost violate the const char * of the monster list.
 - Fixed fleeing monsters trying to run through doors.
 - Made wide-area light light up "knight-move" (L's) squares.
 - Error in "if (t_ptr->name2 = SN_ATTACKS)" fixed (BIG thanks to jk@cs.man.ac.uk).
