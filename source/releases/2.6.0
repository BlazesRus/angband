Background
==========
2.6.0 was a testing version released on 4th September 1994, incorporating a large number of bugfixes and improvements, and merging in those changes that were considered to have worked well in PCAngband.  This was the last large incorporation of ideas from PCAngband - from this point until the variant explosion, development of the game happened in one place.
