=== Angband 2.7.8, Official Version ===

Angband is a "graphical" dungeon adventure game using textual characters
to represent the walls of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, in the
vein of "rogue", "hack", "nethack", and "moria".

There are extensive textual on-line help files in the "lib/help" directory.

This version of Angband will run on Unix/X11, Unix/Curses, Macintosh,
Linux/X11, Linux/Ncurses, Windows, and various forms of IBM compatibles...

See Makefile, h-config.h, and config.h for details on compiling.
See "Makefile.xxx" and "main-xxx.c" for various supported systems.

Send bug reports, suggestions, etc, to "benh@linc.cis.upenn.edu".

There is an Angband newsgroup: "rec.games.roguelike.angband".
